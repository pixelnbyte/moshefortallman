      <h3>Minutes</h3>
      <p>Is the time it takes a small kitchen fire to spread to a full structure fire causing lasting damage and endangering lives. </p>
      <p>The current response time is approximately 12+ minutes and that is when a crew is able to assemble. Sadly our fire department is plagued by long response times, low volunteer rates and overall poor performance. We need <strong>YOUR</strong> vote to help enact change.</p>
