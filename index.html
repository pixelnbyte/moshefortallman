          <p>My name is Moshe Engel, and I'm a local resident and trusted community activist. I’m stepping forward because this community deserves leadership that listens, engages, and delivers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I’ve been serving in Monsey Fire Communications for more than a year. This experience gives me firsthand insight into the operational issues within the department.
            </li>
            <li>I’ve been attending Tallman Fire District meetings for months, learning, listening, and preparing to make real improvements.
            </li>
            <li>I understand the problems and I have a plan to fix them.</li>
            <li>I’m a hard-working family man who lives in the community and cares about the safety of all of us.</li>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>What is a fire commissioner?</h3>
            <p>A fire commissioner is elected to oversee the budget and policies of a fire department or district. As soon as I'm elected, I would be responsible for making sure that your tax dollars are put to the best use. Commissioners also set policies and ensure the department has enough resources, training, and equipment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Who are you running against?</h3>
            <p>The seat that I'm running for is currently filled by a temporary appointee. This is our opportunity to elect new leadership.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>What are the issues with the fire department?</h3>
            <p>Our department currently averages a 13-minute response time, and that’s after Rockland County 911 adds an additional 5 minutes during the initial dispatch call. This is far too long in emergencies where every second truly matters. Far too often, our Fire Department fails to respond at all, leaving Rockland County 911 no choice but to dispatch neighboring departments. We should not have to depend on others to protect our own community. Neighboring departments consistently respond faster, and our district deserves a fully functioning department with a reliable, rapid response.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>How will you improve the fire department?</h3>
            <p>Once elected, I will make recruitment and response time my top priority. This includes actively recruiting more local volunteers and opening an exterior program so community members who want to serve can join the fire service more easily.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Can we get the bell turned off?</h3>
            <p>Modern technology has certainly advanced since the old-fashioned fire alarm was implemented. There are more efficient options available instead of relying on a nuisance that disturbs the peace for miles around.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Who is part of Tallman Fire District?</h3>
            <p>Tallman Fire District, District 20, includes all of Montebello, parts of Airmont, and a section of Monsey. You can use <a href="#hero">our tool</a> to check if your address is within the district.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>I'm not registered to vote, can I still vote?</h3>
            <p>The deadline for registration differs for different elections. Check the Board of Elections of Rockland for details. Register today to avoid forfeiting your civic rights!
            </p>

            <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
